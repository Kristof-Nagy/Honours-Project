The game is still in progress, however I would like to share a bit what I have
planned and implemented so far. Any feedback is more than welcomed, feel free

Known issue(s):
- Upon changing scene or restarting the game from the credit and a task has been
selected already, the first line "To do:" might disappear
- There is no ingame pause and quit, if you feel you had enough, you need to force
alt + f4 to quit the game
